# Animated Maths blog - Jekyll Now

Welcome to the public repo of Animated Maths blog ! We use [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) (now) as a simple and easy to use static blogging engine. This repo is a copy of the official [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repository, with modified styles and layouts. If you like the changes we made, feel free to re-use.
